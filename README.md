# ClassProject-1
A static college website project.

This project was created in an introduction scripting class while in college. The focus of the class was to teach internal javascipt, xml and ajax. I also had to provide internal css on a few pages. We were not allowed to use any other languages or technologies besides html, css, vanilla javascript, xml and ajax.
